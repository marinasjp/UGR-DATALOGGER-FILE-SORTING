Run the main.py file.

Once the script is executed, a prompt should appear in the command line to enter the path of the config.csv file.

Please download the file, write the absolute path of the file in the terminal and click enter. Be careful not to add any leading spaces after the path.

After entering it and clicking enter, the required files will be created and added to the same directory as the main.py file.
